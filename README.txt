This is a generator for those stupid little phrases, like "2spooky4me" and "2edgy4me".

It generates 1-100 at the moment, and you can enter what you want the first and second words to be. For example, entering "edgy" and "me" generates 2edgy4me, 3edgy5me, etc.

Anyway, enjoy this stupid and useless program.

- Change iterations by either addition (currently implemented) or multiplications (planned for future)
