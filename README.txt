This is a generator for those stupid little phrases, like "2spooky4me" and "2edgy4me".

It generates 1-100 at the moment, and you can enter what you want the first and second words to be. For example, entering "edgy" and "me" generates 2edgy4me, 3edgy5me, etc.

At the moment, you can pick how many iterations you want to generate, and how you want to generate them (addition or multiplication).

Anyway, enjoy this stupid and useless program.
